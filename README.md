This repository demonstrates how to design, containerize, and deploy a production-ready Flask web application using Docker and PostgreSQL. It walks through building a clean development environment with Docker Compose, integrating a persistent Postgres database, and configuring a secure production stack powered by Gunicorn and Nginx. The project highlights best practices such as multi-stage Docker builds, non-root containers, environment-based configuration, and proper handling of static and user-uploaded media files—serving as a practical reference architecture for deploying scalable Python microservices.

Below is a video showing myself using this Flask web application to upload an image and view it.
